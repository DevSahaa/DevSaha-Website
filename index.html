        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AccountantðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello my name is Dev Saha. I was born in Anaheim California in the year 2004. I am a California native and have lived most of my life in Corona but now I currently dorm on campus in Riverside. Some of my hobbies are working out, playing basketball, watching shows and movies, and hanging out with friends. I'm a very active guy and take pride in my health. Just recently I've dappled in cooking and eating new foods. I enjoy school and the atmosphere. I am very social and love how in college you are very free to socialize as you wish. Some of my favorite sports players are Kevin Durant and Odell Beckham Jr. Some of my favorite movies are Creed 2, Batman, and the Harry Potter series. A few of my favorite shows are Squid Games and Physical 100. Traveling also interests me even though I haven't been to all of the places I want to go to. I wish to one day be able to visit Tokyo and Europe. <br><br>

        I am currently an Undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside. My major as of now is undeclared but I am going into Pre-Business as soon as possible. A few classes that got me interested in business are Personal Finance that I took my first quarter and Intro to Business that I took this quarter. I excelled in both classes and enjoyed learning each and every day. Some of my working ventures in the past were working for an Air B and B owner to clean and take care of beachfront properties, working in Jersey Mikes, landscaping, and recently I got hired to work at an on campus restauraunt called The Barn. I am excited to begin working again, but I know it will be more of a challenge because of school. Learning the ropes of the job will take effort, but I am willing to do the work. Some valuable skills I've learned in the past from working are how to be respectful to customers, time management, taking orders, and following through on jobs. I hope to become more polished on these skills so that I can be the best version of myself. In the future I want to have multiple sources of income such as real estate and stocks along with my main job. This will allow my money to work for me while I also work for money. This will be the most efficient way for me to reach my goals and live without worry. <br><br>

        Some notible traits about me is that I am hardworking, organized, can work well in teams, and am motivated by my work. There are many qualities of work that motivate me, some of them being, motivation to work, motivation to make money, and motivation to succeed. I am extremely hardworking because of the way I was brought up. I was raised to work for what I had. Being an only child also taught me to work for myself. I want to work to help out my parents. Eventually when I get a well paying job, I will pay back my parents for their investments in me. I want to be successful in the future and not have to worry finanically. I think there are many other important things in life such as relationships with family and friends. Money leads to freedom. Freedom leads to more time with loved ones.
